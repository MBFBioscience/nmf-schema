Neuromorphological File Specification
=====================================


Version 4.0.0 [1]_

.. note::  For additional information, visit MBF Bioscience's user forum for the `Neuromorphological File Specification. <https://forums.mbfbioscience.com/c/neuromorphological-file-specification/34>`_ 


1. Definitions
--------------


1. Research Resource Identifier (RRID): a persistent and unique identifier for referencing a research resource.


2. Introduction to the Neuromorphological File Format
------------------------------------------------------


This specification describes the elements of the neuromorphological data file. The structures represented have been continually developed for over 30 years, balancing accurate 3D representation of microscopic structures with the efficiency for reading, writing, storing, and rendering the reconstruction data. The neuromorphological file format balances structure with flexibility by storing each modeled object as a unique data element, and providing mechanisms for grouping any number and type of data elements. File-level metadata is retained to provide detail on the origin of the sample, ensuring that the provenance of derivative data is tracked and that important source information is not separated from the corresponding data. The decision to implement each neuromorphological structure, from spines to varicosities, was influenced by top neuroscientists who sought to maintain a meaningful model and have the necessary analysis options for that entity. The file specification has evolved with academia and discovery, and will continue to be updated as needed to define added or modified data elements.


3. Neuromorphological File Contents
-----------------------------------

.. note::  The elements defined in the Neuromorpholocial File Specification (4.0) are only consistent with elements in XML data files with the <mbf version="4.0">. XML data files with prior version numbers may contain similar element structures, but will not exactly match this documentation. 

The neuromorphological file format is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition) format and includes two organizational aspects, elements, and attributes [1]. These aspects are detailed in the XML specification provided by The World Wide Web Consortium (WC3). All neuromorphological data files have a header section that includes the file's introductory content followed by any traced data elements. Traced data elements are representations of a diverse range of neuromorphological structures found in microscopy image data.

 
.. code-block:: xml

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
	<mbf version="4.0" appname="ApplicationName" appversion="YYYY.V.M" apprrid="SCR_xxxxx" insrrid="SCR_xxxxx">
	  <description></description>
	  <filefacts></filefacts>
	  <sparcdata></sparcdata>
	  <property name="TimePointManager"></property>
	  <images></images>
	  <thumbnail cols="64" rows="64"></thumbnail>
	
	  TRACING DATA
	
	</mbf>
	
*Figure 1 A Neuromorphological data file.  The header elements are displayed in green. All MBF tracing data is a nested element of the <mbf> element and is represented above with the comment, TRACING DATA.*


3.1 Coordinate Space 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The coordinate space for all neuromorphological data files is a three-dimensional space and all coordinates and measurements are in micrometer units (µm). The origin point of the coordinate system is (0, 0, and 0).

*Figure 2 demonstrates the 3D coordinate space with an origin point of (0, 0, and 0). The gray planes represent a 3D image volume with an image location coordinate, coord: (x, y, and z). Note the direction of the Z-axis. The most positive image plane of the 3D volume is image plane 1. The following image planes are in the same X and Y location, but their z location changes incrementally based on the z scaling. The units of this coordinate space are in micrometers (µm).*


4. Header Elements 
-------------------
The first line of all neuromorphological data files is always the XML declaration element. It contains two attributes, version and encoding, that define the structure and storage units of the neuromorphological file format.


.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

|            |            | software, implying single-byte encoding [2].     |
+------------+------------+--------------------------------------------------+


*Table 1 The XML declaration element, attributes, and descriptions for all fields.*


The remainder of the data file is embedded within the <mbf> element, including file header information and the elements that comprise the tracing data used to model neuronal morphology and surrounding anatomies. The closing </mbf> is the last line of all neuromorphological data files.


.. code-block:: xml

*Table 2 The <mbf> element, attributes, and descriptions for all fields.*


The remaining portion of the header information is described in detail below. File header information includes necessary metadata that helps to describe the data included in the neuromorphological file.



4.1 <description>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The <description> element is a string of user optional text describing the contents of the data file. The format of the text is character data indicated by the CDATA section, used to differentiate the text block from markup.


.. code-block:: xml

    <description><![CDATA[Example description of image segmentation file]]></description>

*Figure 5 The <description> element contains the CDATA start section <![CDATA[ and CDATA end section ]] to indicate a large string of text that is not a data element.*


4.2 <filefacts>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The <filefacts> element stores sequentially ordered serial Z sections for the data file that correspond to physically or virtually sectioned histologic tissue. If no sections have been created for a data file, the only child element of the <filefacts> is the <sectionmanager>. In this case, the values of the <sectionmanager> attributes indicate there have been no sections created and the child element should be disregarded.


.. code-block:: xml

    <filefacts>
	  <sectionmanager currentsection="" sectioninterval="0" startingsection="0"/>
    </filefacts>

*Figure 6 displays the <filefacts> of a data file with no sections. Note the current section has no value, the sectioninterval value is “0”, and the startingsection value is “0”.*


If serial Z sections have been created for the data file, this child element contains meaningful parameters about the sections. Child <section> elements for each Z section are stored in the <filefacts> element.


.. code-block:: xml

	<filefacts>
	   <section sid="S1" name="Section N0" top="z.zz" cutthickness="n.nn" mountedthickness="n.nn"/>
	   <section sid="S2" name="Section N1" top="z.zz" cutthickness="n.nn" mountedthickness="n.nn"/>
	   <section sid="S3" name="Section N2" top="z.zz" cutthickness="n.nn" mountedthickness="n.nn"/>
	   <sectionmanager currentsection="Section Nx" sectioninterval="i" startingsection="N0"/>
	</filefacts>

*Figure 7 The <filefacts> of a data file with serial sections. Each section in the data file has a corresponding <section> element. The attributes of the <sectionmanager> element are now significant values.*


All child elements and attributes of the <filefacts> are defined in Table 3.

|    <section>                  | Each serial Z section generated receives a       |
|                               | <section> element that includes information for  |
|                               | the unique section.                              |

|            |                  | (S1, S2, S3… SN).                                |
+            +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|            | name             | Default names for each section are “Section N”,  |
|            |                  | where N is incremented by the sectioninterval.   |
|            |                  | The names can be user modified.                  |

+            +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|            | sectioninterval  | Indicates the interval of the section names. A   |
|            |                  | section interval i with a startingsection at N0  |
|            |                  | would produce section names: Section N0, Section |
|            |                  | N0+i, Section N0+2i, Section N0+3i ... Section   |
|            |                  | N0+(n)i where n is the total number of sections. |

4.3 <sparcdata>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The <sparcdata> element stores additional subject and annotation metadata. This information allows neuromorphological data files to be queried by species, subject ID, sex, age, and organ of the image sample origin. 

MBF products interface with an external database, Scicrunch that maintains lists of anatomical terms separated by organ, species, and atlas/parcellation scheme. Each anatomy term is associated with a unique identifier and is approved by a team of anatomical experts. The <sparcdata> element informs the species, subject, sex, and age of the image sample segmented along with the exact anatomical list used to segment the image.  


.. code-block:: xml

4.4 <property name="TimePointManager">
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The <property> element named “TimePointManager” will always be present in the neuromorphological data files, however, it is not used at this time. The element can be disregarded.


4.5 <images>
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Raw image data is not saved within neuromorphological data files, rather they are linked with a file location and name and other information about the image.

The <images> element in the header can contain one or many <image> elements enabling the neuromorphological data file to be associated with any number of source images. The images can be either 2D (a single image plane) or 3D (multiple image planes from a single file or multiple files). Image data can be combined in several ways inside the neuromorphological data file. The simplest is the single 3D or 2D image file. See an example in Figure 9. 


.. code-block:: xml

*Table 5 The <image> element, its child elements, attributes, and descriptions for all fields.*

A neuromorphological data file with multiple, distinct images associated to the same file may include many <image> child elements in the <images> element. Each image will have its own set of child elements and attributes.

*Figure 10 An <images> element with multiple distinct images associated with the same data file. Note there are two separate <image> child elements within the <images> element. For concicity, the attributes of each child elements of each <image> have been excluded from the figure, but follow the same structure as see in Figure 9.*

A 3D volume can be made up of many 2D image planes. These volumes are recorded within the neuromorphological data file with one <image> child element and an ordered list of <filename> children elements pointing to the location and file name for each image plane. Each 2D image plane is sequentially loaded from the list into a 3D image volume. The scale is consistent for every image plane. The <coord> reports the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the upper, left-hand corner of the first image plane. The distance between image planes and the number of slices is kept constant for the entire image volume.

*Figure 11 A data file with many 2D image planes that make up a 3D image volume. The file path and image name for each 2D image are reported sequentially in the same <image> child element. In the <zspacing> element, the distance between each 2D image is reported, z=“z.zz”. The number of 2D image planes that construct the 3D volume will equal the total number of slices=”N”. Other image elements have been shortened to emphasize the important differences in this image organization. The <channels>, <scale>, and <coord> attributes are still included in these data files.*

A multi-channel microscopy image can be generated by merging 2 or 3 source images that make up the image color channels. If the images are merged to create a multi-channel image, the <channels> merge attribute will have a value of “yes”. There will always be three <filename> elements that sequentially correspond to the <channel> elements (i.e. <filename>1 will always correspond to the red <channel> element). The <channel> id attribute reports the pseudocolor of the color channel (red, green, or blue). The source attribute defines the image channel number from the source image starting at 0. If no image is selected for a <channel> element, the <filename> will remain but no image path or name is reported and the <channel> source value will equal “none”.

4.6 <thumbnail>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The <thumbnail> element stores data to create a small graphical (64x64) representation of the tracing data. Each of the 64 <thumbnail-line> elements represent one row in the thumbnail. The 64 pixels in each row are represented with a 3-byte hexadecimal (RRGGBB) alphanumeric character.


.. code-block:: xml

    <thumbnail cols="64" rows="64">
       <thumbnail-line>0xRR1GG1BB1RR2GG2BB2...RR64GG64BB64</thumbnail-line>

*Figure 13 The <thumbnail> element, child elements, attributes, and values as they apear in the data file. The cols and rows attributes define the pixel dimentions of the 2D traced data thumbnail. A <thumbnail-line> child elements is present for every row of the <thumbnail>, but it is abbriviated here for concision. There are RRGGBB characters for each column of the data file. In the figure, the subscript numbers indicate the column number for the character.*


5.Trace Data
------------


The traced data elements include all data models of neuromorphological structures and additional image annotations. A data file will not necessarily contain all traced data elements. Typically a data file will include more than one of a single traced element in a data file. For example, there may be many contours of the same contour type and/or of a different contour type depending on what has been segmented. Figure 14 demonstrates the general organization of all trace data elements with a neuromorphological data file.


.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <mbf>

      </tree> 
      <vessel></vessel>  
      <text></text>  
      <scalebar></scalebar>  
    </mbf>

*Figure 14 Demonstrates the organization of all traced data elements in the Neuromorphological file format. All traced data and header elements are child elements of  the <mbf> element. The <spine> and <varicosity> elements are child elements of the <tree>. The order and number of these elements within the parent <tree> may vary. The header elements are represented with the HEADER ELEMENTS comment and do not actually appear this way in the data file. They have been abbreviated to focus attention on the traced data elements.*


5.1 Common Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


5.1.1 Color
###########


The color attribute is seen in many neuromorphological file elements. It uses a 3-byte hexadecimal (RRGGBB) alphanumeric character to represent the color of traced structures.

5.1.2 <point>
#############


The nested element <point> is included in several elements of the neuromorphological  file format to denote a point at a distinct X, Y, and Z location with a 3D micrometer coordinate space. The <point> element also includes a diameter value indicating the thickness at that point. These coordinates are represented using the corresponding x, y, z, and d attributes and are always in micrometer units.


.. code-block:: xml

    <point x="x.xx" y="y.yy" z="z.zz" d="d.dd"/>

*Figure 15 The <point> element, attributes, and values as they apear in the data file.*


5.1.3 <property name="Channel">
###############################


The “Channel” <property> indicates the image color channel used to trace an object. If a detection is performed on only one of the image color channels, then that image channel is reported for the detected data element. If the detection is performed on two or more color channels, the <property name= “Channel”> element will not be written for that structure. If the image is monochrome, the <property name= “Channel”> element will not be written for any structure. Child elements are expected to be detected in the same color channel as their parent structure. For example, a <branch>, <spine>, or <varicosity> is expected to be detected in the same color channel as the associated <tree>.

*Table 6 The <property name=”Channel”> element, values, and descriptions for all fields.*


5.1.4 <property name="Set">
###########################


The <property> named “Set” can be found in any trace data element. The <property> is used to name and group one or many trace data elements. These elements can either be the same type (ex. just <tree> elements) or different types (ex. <marker>, <tree>, and <contour> elements). A set has one value that is a text string indicating the name of that set. An element can be associated with multiple “Set” properties.


.. code-block:: xml

    <contour name="Soma 1" color="#FFFF00" closed="true" shape="Contour">
      <property name="GUID"></property>
      <property name="FillDensity"></property>
      <property name="Set"><s>EXAMPLE SET NAME</s></property>
      <point x="x.xx" y="y.yy" z="z.zz" d="d.dd"/>
    </contour>


*Figure 17 An example of the  “Set”  <property> and its text string value, <s>EXAMPLE SET NAME</s>. In this example, the <contour> element “Soma 1” has been placed into a set called EXAMPLE SET NAME. The <contour> includes the child  element <property name=”Set”> and the unique set name to indicate it belongs to the group of trace elements.*


5.2 <marker>
^^^^^^^^^^^^


The neuromorphological file format uses the <marker> element to represent single points in the data file. The only child element of the <marker> is the <point> element indicating the X, Y, and Z, location of the <marker> and the diameter of the point. Each <point> represents the center of one marker of specific marker type. A <marker> type can hold one or many <point> elements, each representing an independent marked location.  


.. code-block:: xml

    <marker type="Plus" color="#RRGGBB" name="ExampleName" varicosity="false">
      <property name="Channel"></property>
      <point x="x.xx" y="y.yy" z="z.zz" d="d.dd"/>
      <point x="x.xx" y="y.yy" z="z.zz" d="d.dd"/>

    </marker>

*Figure 18 The <marker> element, child elements, attributes, and values as they apear in the data file. This <marker> type is Plus and is linked to a + symobol.*


Each <marker> attribute, including type, color, name, and varicosity, is defined in Table 7.

*Table 7 The <marker> element, child elements, and all attributes. Each data component includes a corresponding description.*


Makers can be associated with other traced objects including <contour> and <tree> elements. This section highlights the change in location of the <marker> when it is associated with another element. The <marker> becomes a child element to the parent <contour> or <tree> it is associated with and is always placed after the last <point> of the parent element.

5.3 Punctum
^^^^^^^^^^^
Punctum volumes are represented with an extended version of the <marker> element. They contain all of the <marker> attributes, which are detailed in the <marker> section above. All punctum <marker> elements have the value “Punctum” for the name attribute differentiating them from a typical <marker> element. Similar to <marker> elements, punctum also include one <point> child element. This <point> describes the punctum’s center of mass, reporting an X, Y, and Z coordinate along with a diameter.

.. code-block:: xml

    <marker type="OpenCircle" color="#RRGGBB" name="Punctum" varicosity="false">

    </marker>

*Figure 20 A “Punctum” represented with the <marker> element. In this figure, the <property name=” “> child elements exclude or abbrivate values for concision.*

The punctum <marker> element also includes three <property> elements named “Channel”, “Punctum”, and “VolumeRLE”. The “Channel” is defined in the common components section of the document. “Punctum” and “VolumeRLE” are described in detail below.

*Table 9 The <property name=”VolumeRLE”> element, its values, and a descriptions for all fields. The Figure Variable column corresponds to the variables in Figure 22.*

The final values of the “VolumeRLE” <property> include a list of the foreground and background voxels that construct a cuboid enclosing the punctum volume. The foreground voxels are the voxels within the cuboid with a high luminance that make up the punctum’s volume. The foreground and background voxels are reported as a series of numbers indicating the voxels run lengths within the cuboid. The first run will count the number of background voxels beginning at the cuboids defined origin and ending at the first foreground voxel. The next number of the string reports the run of foreground voxels until the next background voxel is reached. The run-length moves positively in X until the cuboid boundary is reached. Next, the voxels are reported for the second line of Y until the first Z plane has been reported. The voxels are reported in the same pattern until all Z planes making up the cuboid have been reported.

*Figure 25 (a) A condensed <tree> element of the Neuromorphological file format. All properties of <tree> and <branch> are fully depicted, however, the <point> elements have been abbreviated using an ellipsis to draw focus to the structure of the <tree>. The column on the left of the figure includes the name of the segment for the corresponding like of the data file. Each node, origin, and ending point is labeled with a gray arrow pointing to the appropriate line of the data file. (b) A diagram demonstrating the structure of a <tree> with each segment shown as a gray line and labeled with the segment name (ex. S2-2-2).  The origin (O), nodes (N) and endings (E) of the tree are marked with a circle. The root segment (S) begins with the origin (O) point and terminates with the node (N0). The child segments of N0, S1 and S2, terminate with nodes N1 and N2. The child segments of N1, S1-2 and S1-1 terminate with endings E1-1 and E1-2. N2 has two child segments, S2-1 and S2-2. Segment S2-1 has no bifurcations, so it terminates with ending E2-1. Segment S2-2 bifurcates at node N2-1. Lastly, the branches S2-2-1 and S2-2-2 terminate with endings E2-2-1 and E2-2-2.*


Trees consist of an origin, branches, nodes, and endings. The starting point of <tree> element is referred to as the origin and the points that follow make up the root branch of the <tree>. All trees must have at least an origin and root branch, but typically have branching points called nodes. Nodes are where a segment of the <tree> splits into multiple <branch> child elements. The <branch> elements are made up of an ordered list of points that connect nodes to nodes, and nodes to endings. Endings are the last point of a <branch> or <tree> where the segment terminates.

Table 12 describes the attributes of a tree and additional child elements.

*Table 12 The <tree> element, its child elements, and all attributes. Each data component includes a corresponding description.*


There are two more child elements of the <tree>. Both varicosities and spines are related to a specific point location on a neuron. Therefore, it is necessary to represent this relationship in the neuromorphological data structure. The <varicosity> and <spine> elements are nested within their corresponding <tree> or <branch>, and are located between the <tree> or <branch> points that they were detected. Each of these elements is detailed in the corresponding sections below.



5.5.1.1 <spine> 
***************


Spines are small projections off of neuronal trees. They have a high postsynaptic density that helps to transmit electrical signals to the cell body . Because spines occur at a unique point location on a neuronal branch, the neuromorphological data format embeds the spine element in the associated branch, recorded between the tree points that the spine occurs. Each <spine> has a set of attributes, <property> elements, and one <point> element used to define the detected object. The <point> child element describes the spine head’s center of mass, reporting the X, Y, and Z coordinates along with the diameter of the spine head (see the last child element of the spine in Figure 26).


The neuromorphological file format includes two modeling methods for a spine, one more simple and succinct than the other. The simple modeling method is referred to as a ball and stick representation. When a spine is manually placed, the head location and thickness is defined using the spine <point> property. The <point> element of the parent <tree> of the <spine> defines the location that the spine connects to the branch.

*Table 17 The <property name=”VolumeRLE”> element, its values, and a descriptions for all fields. The Figure Variable column corresponds to the variables in Figure 31.*


The final values of the “VolumeRLE” <property> include a list of the foreground and background voxels that construct a cuboid enclosing the spine volume. The foreground voxels are the voxels within the cuboid with a high luminance that make up the spine’s volume. The foreground and background voxels are reported as a series of numbers indicating the voxels run lengths within the cuboid. The first run will count the number of background voxels beginning at the cuboids defined origin and ending at the first foreground voxel. The next number of the string reports the run of foreground voxels until the next background voxel is reached. The run-length moves positively in X until the cuboid boundary is reached. Next, the voxels are reported for the second line of Y until the first Z plane has been reported. The voxels are reported in the same pattern until all Z planes making up the cuboid have been reported. 


5.5.1.2 <varicosity> 
********************


Neuronal varicosities, or boutons, are clusters of neurotransmitters that appear along neuronal trees as swellings in the branch. Since the structures are part of the neuronal tree, it is necessary to represent their relationship to the corresponding branch and point location. In the neuromorphological data file, the <varicosity> element is nested within the relating <tree> and is made up of five <point> elements that coalesce to form the volume of that varicosity. Each <point> diameters (d) describes the thickness of the varicosity at that location.

*Figure 32 (a) The data format for one <varicosity> element nested with a <tree>. For conciseness, the attributes of most <point> elements have been abbreviated with an ellipsis. (b) A diagram of a varicosity along a neuronal tree. The five points of the varicosity are represented with gray circles. Each has a thickness, d. The varicosity’s center point thickness describes the maximum diameter of the varicosity. The length of the varicosity is the distance between the first and last varicosity points. By averaging the diameters of the first and last varicosity points, the branch thickness is estimated.*


Each attribute of the varicosity element is described in Table 18.

5.5.2 Somas and Cell Bodies
###########################


2D or 3D cell bodies are represented using the <contour> element or groups of <contour> elements. The differentiating factor between a contour and a cell body is found in the name attribute of the <contour>. All cell body contours have names containing “soma “(case insensitive and space relevant).  3D cell bodies are traced using multiple contours of the same name at different z positions outlining the entire Z space of the cell body region.

*Figure 33 Multiple <contour> elements  named “Soma N”, indicating all <contour> elements make up a single cell body. The cell body <contour> contains the same child elements, attributes, and values of a <contour>. These have been abbriviated in the figure with a verticle ellipsis for the last three <contour> elements. The <property name=” “> child elements of the first <contour> listed exclude all values for concision. The <point> attributes have been abbriviated in this figure with an ellipsis. A contour usually contains a list of many <point> elements, connected based on the order they are listed. These have also been abbriviated in the figure with a vertical ellipsis.*


.. note::  It’s possible that data files may represent cell bodies with a contour name=”CellBody” and the closed attribute will equal “false”. This represents a closed cell body contour despite being marked as open.

Structures like vasculature or nerve bundles are be represented with a different branching structure than the trees. In the neuromorphological file format, <vessel> elements are made up of <nodes> that connect by <edges>. The <edge> is a collection of connected points. The connections relationships are described with the <edgelists> element.

The <vessel> elements can have edges that loop, whereas <tree> elements can only branch. The looping capability of the <vessel> elements is known as a graph structure and allows for the representation of biological structures such as anastomoses in vascular or neuronal networks.  


The <vessel> attributes are detailed in Table 19.

Lastly, the <edgelist> element holds the key for how the nodes and edges relate. Each nested <edgelist> has four attributes. The <edgelist> is given a unique ID, recorded with the id attribute. The edge attribute includes the id of the <edge> element (branch of the vessel) the <edgelist> is describing the node relationship for. The sourcenode attribute is the ID of the <node> that the <edge> starts from, where the targetnode attribute is the ID of the <node> that the <edge> ends at.  If either the sourcenode or target node values equal -1, this means that there is no starting node and this is the origin of the vessel.

*Figure 37 (a) The data format for the <edgelists> child element of a <vessel>. Each <edgelist> id attribute corresponds to the <edgelist> ids in Figure 37b, informing how the <vessel> <edge> elements connect to the <node> elements. The edge attributes correspond to the edge ids in Figure 36. The sourcenode and targetnode values refer to a node id in Figure 35. (b) A diagram of the <edgelists> element in Figure 37a. Each <edgelist> and <edge> id correspond to one of the vessel branches. The <edgelist> sourcenode and targetnode inform the start and endpoint of the vessel branch or <edge>. For example, edge=”4” (E4) begins at node 2 (N2) and ends at node 3 (N3). This connection is indicated in <edgelist> id=4 (see Figure 37a). This connection of the vessel back onto itself creates a loop structure.*
