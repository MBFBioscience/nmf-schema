Editor Election Process
-----------------------
This document describes the process by which members of the neuromorphological file format community are elected to the editorial board.

The :doc:`Neuromorphological File Format Editorial Board </Election>` consists of five members of the neuromorphological file format community, each serving a term of three years. Membership of the neuromorphological file format community is defined as being subscribed to the nmf-community@mbfbioscience.com list serve. Each year, an election is held to replace the one or two serving editors who have completed their three-year term. The election process is managed by the current editorial board and all information provided during the process is kept confidential to its members. Here, we define the procedure for holding an election. If circumstances require an election to be held at a different time, the same procedure will be followed with suitable changes in the specified timing.

The MBF Representative of the neuromorphological file format editorial board will not be elected and will always be a representative member from the MBF Bioscience team. The role of the MBF Representative is to ensure any modification or additions to the file format are compatible with MBF Bioscience software. They are also meant to advise the Editorial Board using past experiences and expertise on microanatomical digital modeling.
