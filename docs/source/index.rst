The neuromorphological file format is a machine-readable format for representing digital reconstructions and models of microscopic anatomies. 
The unique data structure has a direct impact on microanatomical models, analytics, and data reusability. It’s relevant, systematic, and flexible nature demonstrates its effectiveness as a solution for the microscopic anatomy morphology data standard.
The framework is suitable for representing models commonly found in research on a number of topics, including neuromorphology, vascular networks, and neuroanatomy.
